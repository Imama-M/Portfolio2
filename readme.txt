Assignment 2 of Web and Script Programming, The Portfolio but extended with new features and different ways of doing it.

To do this assignment, I used all of my old css and html files from assigment 1 and made a few adjustments like: converting the html files to 
ejs files and changing the sizing and margins when needed. However, most of the code is from the lectures, little of it isn't and I mention where its from.


HOW MANY FILES: There are 6 EJS files, 4 of them are the actual pages for the website, while error is for error handling
and index is for organizing the code for the different pages. There are 2 JS files that are used for rendering and more organization of the code.
There are 4 CSS files, one for each page of the website (located in Asset in Public), theres a video and 2 images as well, and then there are the 
JSON files.

Code Source: Majority of the code is from the lectures and tutorials, they've just been customized and readjusted. 
The bootstrap and fontawesomes that was used are the same ones that were used in the lectures. 
One thing from outside the lecture code is learning how to convert my HTML files to EJS files, I learned that from this website https://blog.openreplay.com/serving-dynamic-html-using-embedded-javascript-ejs/.


Media used: All the images and the video used in the pages are things I made myself. There was 1 video and 2 pictures.

Colour Scheme: the color pallete I chose is the same one that I used in assigment 1, just used a separate purple for the navbar/footnote.

Version Control: I started pushing all my code to github on November 4th, even though I kept up with the code through the lectures.
